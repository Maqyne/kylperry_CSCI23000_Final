Formal relationships and contractual agreements that you enter into today are poised to really pay off.",
    "Turn all your attention toward resolving unfinished business today. Is there a project you left half finished, a person who is waiting to hear from you or an errand you need to run? Get on it as soon as you can this morning. Minor plans could turn into major headaches if you're not too careful. Don't be shy—make as many phone calls as it takes to reconnect with the people you need to speak with. You'll be grateful you went through all the effort.",
    "Your enthusiasm will get you noticed in a positive way, but don't overdo it, or else you might start getting a very bad type of attention. There's a fine line between being entertaining and being obnoxious, and you need to understand the difference. If you feel like gushing or venting about something, save it for your inner circle. These folks know you well and embrace your more extreme emotions. Letting down your guard is safe with them.",
    "You're cruising nicely along the river of life right now, so why not just relax, dip your toes into the water and enjoy the ride for a while? Things are going well in just about every area of your life, from your growing sense of accomplishment at work or school to your personal pride in how well you've been taking care of yourself (good for you!). Other people are eager to join in the relaxation with you, so plan an impromptu social event tonight.",
    "When you're this close to reaching a goal, it can be quite tempting to cut a few corners or be a little bit conniving in order to reach that goal faster. But this is not a wise idea—the stars say that you need to continue on this path at the steady pace you've established. Let things unfold as they need to, not as you might want them to! Things have gone very well so far—so just have faith and try to be more patient.",
    "Someone in your circle—either at work or in your social group—is going through some changes that could easily be considered inspirational. Give credit where credit is due, and make sure you communicate how impressed you are. It can be hard to praise someone (especially someone who might not be your favorite person), but acknowledging truth can be an empowering act. Think of the greater benefit to yourself, and pat someone else on the back.",
    "You may feel an urgent desire to embark on a few new projects today—and today is a good day for that! But make sure that you proceed carefully. Research and planning might not seem like a lot of fun, but they are necessary—you need to fully understand what you'll encounter on the road ahead. Rushing heedlessly toward something new might be very exciting, but it's not much fun to hit a dead end, now is it?",
    "Are you finding yourself running out of time? Today someone will call to cancel a meeting unexpectedly—this may disappoint you in one way, but in another way, it will be quite a blessing. You should appreciate the big hole that this will put in your schedule, and don't be in a hurry to fill it with anything. See how the day unfolds, and stay spontaneous to keep yourself interested and stimulated. Dates and times are not written in stone.",
    "Let your bold personality shine today. You will be totally fiery and full of energy, so put that to good use by pushing the envelope, saying things that everyone is thinking but no one has the courage to say and exploring all the boundaries of your world. Today is a great day to try something that you have always been just a little too scared to try. Your fears are vanishing. If you want something today, ask for it. (If you don't, you may never get it!)",
    "The time is right for a successful trip—if you are planning any travel, today is the day to push these plans forward and make them happen. Making all the arrangements could take more time than you thought, but there are some amazing bargains and upgrade opportunities just ripe for the picking. All you have to do is look in some unusual places, and you will find them. Get your traveling companion to help you out—after all, the more help, the better!",
    "A person who recently made a big splash in your life is starting to act a bit unusual—keep your distance for the next few days, or at least until you get a better idea of who this person really is. The first impression he or she made may have been orchestrated very carefully. It's going to take a little bit more time for you to figure out what the truth behind the facade is. Don't rush yourself.",
    "Trust your senses today, even if they tell you something that the facts don't support—yet. It is only a matter of time before you are proved to have been right all along, so just bide your time and bite your tongue. Of course, someone as gracious and as mature as you won't gloat when your victory comes, but there is no reason you can't make sure people recognize the fact that you know what you're doing. Expect people to want you to be on their team from now on.",
    "The people around you are going to be full of energy today—and just this once, you might be lagging a bit behind the crowd. To catch up, grab onto someone's coattails (with her or his permission, of course) and pull yourself along until you can muster up the energy to maintain your momentum on your own. Everyone is in this together, and they want you with them—so no one is going to mind if you need help catching up right now.",
    "There is no reason for you to take anything too seriously right now, so lighten up! Every argument has two sides, and you should accept the fact that everyone has his or her own perspective on things. There isn't always only one right answer. If you take another look at complicated situations right now, you will be able to separate the good parts from the bad easily and adjust your opinion to take more people into account.",
    "Your unconscious mind is making choices you might not be aware of. Today, it's time to take a larger view of your life and your recent actions. Things might be in danger of getting a bit out of control. If you've been spending a lot of money, it's time to start sticking to a budget and cutting out one or two indulgences. Discipline is good for you right now—it will prepare you for something big that's coming soon. You won't regret delaying gratification.",
    "Today you may be tempted to jump into a chaotic situation that looks like a lot of fun -- but it might actually end up being quite unpleasant. There is definitely something you don't know yet. Let the drama unfold a bit more before you get involved; otherwise, you could get caught up in something you don't fully understand. Have a little patience, and proceed only when everything looks good to go.",
    "If you've been dying to experience something new in your life, you will get a grand opportunity to do so today. Someone you don't know very well will propose a crazy idea—so crazy that it just might work! Are you in or out? Gather all your courage and dive on in! You need to start taking more chances, don't you think? Risk is the only way to give yourself the excitement you're craving. You don't need another quiet, safe evening at home right now.",
    "You clean your kitchen when it gets messy, you clean your car when the back seat gets cluttered, and you should clean your mind when it gets full of negative things. This isn't a question of ignoring real problems you may be mulling over, it's a question of letting go of worry. There are things you just can't do anything about—those are the things you have to stop thinking about today. Move on with positive thoughts, and leave the old ones behind.",
    "There is strength in numbers, as you will find out today. You may not usually be a 'joiner,' but if you become part of a crowd today, you won't be sorry. Positive things will start happening faster than you could have hoped for. Don't worry—this is not a case of becoming a sheep just for the sake of fitting in. You won't lose your identity just by being part of a group of people, especially if those people share your goals and ideals."
